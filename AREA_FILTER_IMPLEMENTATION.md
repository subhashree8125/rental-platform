## 📋 Filter Breakdown

### Filters Based on Location:
1. **District** - Select dropdown (shows all unique districts)
2. **Cities** - Checkboxes (filtered by selected district)
3. **Areas** - Checkboxes (filtered by selected district, uses dedicated `area` column)

### Address Field:
- **Purpose**: Free-text detailed house address
- **Used for**: Display only (in cards, modals, property listings)
- **NOT used for**: Filtering

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Creating a Property:
```
User Input:
  - Address: "123 Main Street, Building A, Flat 5B"
  - City: "Chennai"
  - Area: "Anna Nagar"
  - District: "Chennai"

Stored in DB:
  - address: "123 Main Street, Building A, Flat 5B"
  - city: "Chennai"
  - area: "Anna Nagar"
  - district: "Chennai"

Used for Filtering:
  - district: ✅ Yes
  - city: ✅ Yes
  - area: ✅ Yes
  - address: ❌ No (display only)
```

### Property Display:
- **Property Cards**: Show `address, area, city, district`
